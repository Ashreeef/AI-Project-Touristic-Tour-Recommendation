# Touristic Tour Recommendation

## Overview
This project aims to generate a one-week itinerary for travelers in Algeria by leveraging AI search algorithms and Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques. The system minimizes travel time and cost while maximizing user satisfaction based on preferences such as historical, cultural, or natural attractions.

## Features
- **Attraction Database**: A dataset of Algerian tourist destinations with coordinates, costs, ratings, and categories.
- **Search Algorithms**:
  - Uninformed: (e.g., BFS, DFS, or Uniform Cost)
  - Informed: A* (or IDA*) with a custom heuristic
  - Local Search: Hill Climbing
- **CSP**: Scheduling daily attractions under budget and travel-time constraints.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly website for entering preferences and viewing the recommended itinerary, with cost/time breakdowns and optional map visualizations.
